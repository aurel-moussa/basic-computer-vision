"""Project Overview
In this course, you learned how to train and use custom classifiers. 
For the project in this module, you will develop a new custom classifier using one of the classification methods 
you learnt and then deploy it as a web app using Code Engine. 

Project Scenario
You have been employed as a Junior Data Scientist by Jokwu, a self-driving car start-up in Capetown, South Africa. 
Jokwu has created the hardware and parts of the car, and they are beginning to create sensors; 
the next step is to have a working model that identifies traffic signs. 
The project and product team have decided to start with stop signs - is it a stop sign or not?

As a first step, you have been given a dataset and tasked with training a model that identifies the stop signs in an image. 
This will be integrated into a motion detector as a next step.

Project Tasks
Your job is to load the training images, 
create features, 
and train the model. 
You will then deploy the model to Code Engine so your manager 
can upload an image of a stop sign and your image classifier 
will classify the image and tell them to what accuracy it predicts it is correct. 
You will utilize CV Studio to develop this model and then deploy it as a web app by completing the tasks below.

Once you are done, please take screenshots of your results to upload them for a peer evaluation. 
Task 1: Gather and Upload Your Data
Task 2: Train Your Classifier
Task 3: Deploy Your Model
Task 4: Test Your Classifier
Task 5: Submit Your Assignment and Evaluate Your Peers"""

#GATHERING AND UPLOADING DATA
#Downloaded the images for stop sign and not stop sign
#Uploaded them to IBM CV Studio
#Ensured that all images are pre-labelled correctly (according to name of the folder)

#TRAINING THE CLASSIFIER
#Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with PyTorch.
